# Python Text-Based Adventure Game
This is the README.md file for the development of this project.

This game is a test-based python adventure game. This game came out of an interest in old-school text-based RPGs. My desire with this project is to implement the logic of python to create a game that mirrors what I have encountered before and maybe adds upon some features.

Game development is new to me, so bear with please. I am learning as I go in terms of how to structure this program based off of my knowledge and understanding of python but also trying to make it easily understood and extensible by others.

## Core Components:
**Logic**:   <br>
**Structure**: The structures follows the schematic that I have drawn below. This

```
├── tests
│   ├── __init__.py (A debug test to make sure the generated ONNX model works.
│   │               Uses ONNX.js to load and run the generated ONNX model.)
│   │
│   └── test_maps.py (A file contained to test the functions
│                      implemented with graphAlgs)

├── classes
│   ├── Player.py (Consists of the base class Player, that is

│   └── Mage.py   (Consists of the Mage class which inherits from
│                   Player and adds support for MP and spell logic.)

└── train_mnist_model.pt (Trains the PyTorch model and saves the trained
                          parameters as pytorch_model.pt.)

**Map**: The game uses graphs implemented via a dict-of-dicts or dict-of-dicts-of-dicts with the construction being outsourced to the networkx module. This module provides me with the basics of graph construction and a few algorithms albeit I have chosen to implement those algorithms myself to more understand their logic and how they work and how to best integrate them in the future for additional game mechanics. <br>

## Goals:
### To Implement
- [ ] Finish basics of game logic  
  - [ ] Get the start of game setup
  - [ ] Integrate game with movement
  - [ ] Write some sorting algorithms for the inventory sorting  
  - [ ] Get the random encounters working
  - [ ] Write an exp level up function
  - [ ] Get the shop working
    - [ ] add gold acquisition methods



- [ ] More comprehensive testing
  - [ ] determine how to best write the tests with pytest.  
  - [ ] test new functions as implemented

### Stretch implementations
- [ ] Additional functionalities  
  - [ ] Maybe extend to allow a "companion" assistant during battle.
  - [ ] Add fishing
- [ ] Additional Classes
  - [ ] Ranger with a companion monster and advanced scouting?
    - [ ] Character pathfinding. Maybe this class has support for utilizing the graph pathfinding algorithms to find the closest path between current location and the next town or chest or something?
  - [ ] Cleric with heals?
- [ ] Get random item drops?
